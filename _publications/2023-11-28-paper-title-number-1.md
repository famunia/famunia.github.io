Introduction: The illness known as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is diverse in nature, with its etiology and pathology believed to result from the interplay of genetic and environmental factors throughout intrauterine and postnatal development. Methods and Materials: This cross-section observational study was carried out in Al Manar Hospital and SIBL Hospital. The duration of the period from July 2021 to June 2022. A total of 150 patients participated in the study. After collection, the data were checked and cleaned, followed by editing, compiling, coding and categorizing according to the objectives and variables to detect errors and to maintain consistency, relevancy and quality control. Statistical evaluation of the results used to be obtained via the use of a window-based computer software program devised with Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS-25). Results: Maximum (42%) patients were within the age group of 25-30 years. Only 4.84% had more than 40 years of age. Mean (SD) age was 26+ 11.6 years. Regarding age of marriage maximum (77.6%) of the patients age of marriage was 13-18 years. 46.67% of the patients were underweight, 40% were within normal range and 13.33% were overweight. Regarding Pharmacological measures, 40% patients were given Clomiphene citrate, 20% Letrozole and 6.67% gonadotropin therapy. About 33.33% were undergoing Ovarian drilling. Here, Success rate for Pharmacological measures was 72% (N-100) And Success rate for Ovarian drilling was 65% (N=50). Conclusion: Comprehensive evaluation of the infertility is required to rule out alternative reasons of infertility in PCOS. PCOS therapy is still debatable because it is a common syndrome and the leading cause of infertility. Lomifene citrate and letrozole are also considered first-line treatments. The second line of treatment is gonadotrophin therapy and ovarian drilling.
